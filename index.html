<p>Please create a web page for your project. Your project page should contain the following sections and content:</p>

<p><strong>TITLE.</strong> Parallel Hash Tables. Brought to you by Manu Garg, Andrew Butko.</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY.</strong> We are going to implement concurrent hash tables that use coarse grained/fine grained locks. 
We are also going to implement lock-free hash tables. 
Finally we're going to analyze the implementations of each of them by testing them on different programs with different data access patterns.</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND.</strong> A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values and allows fast accesses to the data.
More on hash tables: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table" /></p>

<p><strong>THE CHALLENGE.</strong>
The problem is challenging because lock-free data structures are hard, 
for instance if we implement the hash tables with separate chaining then deletion is going to be an issue.
Another problem would be resizing the hash table on an insert and ensuring that is still lock-free. </p>

<p><strong>RESOURCES.</strong> 
We will be using C++ for the coding aspects of this assignment and the GHC machines for testing/analyzing the performance of the code.
We will most likely start the code from scratch but will be using ideas from research papers to supplement the implementation. 
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/spaa-2002.pdf" /> looks promising. </p>

<p><strong>GOALS AND DELIVERABLES.</strong> Describe the deliverables or goals of your project.</p>

<p>This is by far the most important section of the proposal:</p>

<ul>
<li>Separate your goals into what you PLAN TO ACHIEVE (what you believe you must get done to have a successful project and get the grade you expect) and an extra goal or two that you HOPE TO ACHIEVE if the project goes really well and you get ahead of schedule. It may not be possible to state precise performance goals at this time, but we encourage you be as precise as possible. If you do state a goal, give some justification of why you think you can achieve it.  (e.g., I hope to speed up my starter code 10x, because if I did it would run in real-time.)</li>
<li>If applicable, describe the demo you plan to show at the parallelism computation (will it be an interactive demo? will you show an output of the program that is really neat? will you show speedup graphs?).  Specifically, what will you show us that will demonstrate you did a good job?</li>
<li>If your project is an analysis project, what are you hoping to learn about the workload or system being studied? What question(s) do you plan to answer in your analysis?</li>
<li>Systems project proposals should describe what the system will be capable of and what performance is hoped to be achieved.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PLATFORM CHOICE.</strong> Describe why the platform (computer and/or language) you have chosen is a good one for your needs. Why does it make sense to use this parallel system for the workload you have chosen?</p>

<p><strong>SCHEDULE.</strong> Produce a schedule for your project.  <em>Your schedule should have at least one item to do per week</em>. List what you plan to get done each week from now until the parallelism competition in order to meet your project goals. Keep in mind that due to other classes, you'll have more time to work some weeks than others (work that into the schedule). You will need to re-evaluate your progress at the end of each week and update this schedule accordingly. Note the intermediate checkpoint deadline is April 16th. In your schedule we encourage you to be precise as precise as possible. It's often helpful to work backward in time from your deliverables and goals, writing down all the little things you'll need to do (establish the dependencies!).</p>

<h2>Project Checkpoint (due Fri, April 15th)</h2>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
